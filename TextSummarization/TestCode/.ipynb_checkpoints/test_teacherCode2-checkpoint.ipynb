sickness fast and deep breathing confusion blurred vision or spots in front of your eyes and ringing in your ears the symptoms of can come on very quickly and with little warning if you experience the above symptoms it is a good idea to conduct measures which when done immediately upon feeling symptoms can help you avoid a episode medical experts suggest that you lie or sit down and place your head between your knees these positions will help restore blood flow to the brain and can prevent a episode if standing you can also cross your legs and tightening your muscles this is effective if you are in a crowded place and you are unable to lie down immediately by preparing you can ensure that you are in a safe and secure place when you faint try telling someone near you what is happening and ask

condition in fact spells may be caused by anxiety fear pain emotional stress hunger dehydration surprise overexertion choking or drug and alcohol use if you suspect that your spells are being caused by one of these issues there are measures you can take to prevent future episodes hydration is the best way to prevent spells without medication drinking more water is ideal but you can get fluids from food sources like watermelon milk etc all beverages including sodas should be eliminated if you are sufficiently hydrated you will be urinating regularly and your urine will be clear or light

      "Question :  [\"of cleaning wood tile linoleum or vinyl flooring materials are much easier to clean and will not harbor allergens like a carpet would if you're allergic to guinea pigs it's important to remember that the protein responsible for that allergy is mostly found in the animal's saliva and urine however that protein can be to the guinea pig's coat or skin during grooming or passing waste and may be to your skin if you handle the guinea pig or its bedding therefore the urine saliva hair and skin dander should all be considered potential sources of allergen exposure exposure to these allergens can cause symptoms immediately or after numerous days weeks months or even years of exposure if you are unable to avoid being around a guinea pig for whatever reason make sure you avoid contact with these sources of allergens if contact cannot be avoided make sure you take protective measures protective equipment may allow you to handle guinea pigs and their bedding or simply be around guinea pigs without experiencing allergic reactions protective equipment may not be enough though and you may need to take some type of allergy medication for extra safety wearing a dust mask can help prevent bronchial irritation and asthma like symptoms if you've experienced those symptoms in the past gloves and long sleeved shirts can help reduce your skin contact with guinea pigs especially while handling the animals themselves or cleaning their cages do not wear the long sleeved shirt you wore while handling your guinea pig for other purposes unless it's been washed since the last time you came into contact with the guinea pig or its bedding any time you've handled a guinea pig cleaned its enclosure or handled any materials from inside that enclosure make sure you wash your hands as soon as possible it's important to follow proper hand washing techniques to ensure that your skin is clean and free of allergens to reduce or prevent a reaction get your hands wet under the faucet with clean running water the temperature doesn't really matter since the point is to wash away allergens and not germs apply enough soap to adequately cover both hands with the lather work the soap between your hands between your fingers on the backs of your hands and under your fingernails apply soap to any other part of your body that may have come in contact with allergens wrists and arms for example scrub the soap on your skin for at least 20 seconds a common way to keep time is by singing or humming the happy birthday song twice in a row while you scrub your skin if you've been bitten or scratched by a guinea pig wash the site of your injury with soap and water for 15 minutes or longer to ensure that you remove the allergens from the wound rub your hands under the tap to wash away any traces of soap which should also remove the allergens your skin came into contact with use a clean dry paper towel to wipe your hands dry discard the paper towel when you are finished depending on your situation you may be able to find someone else willing to take on guinea pig duties for you ask others you live or work with if they would be willing to take over these responsibilities if you work at a pet store let your know that you've experienced allergic reactions to guinea pigs and request that you be excused from handling feeding or cleaning them if your guinea pig is a pet at home ask a family member or roommate to take over guinea pig duties if you can't find anyone willing to do this you may have to consider giving your guinea pig to a home where allergies won't be a problem though it's always difficult to part with a pet you may not have a choice if your allergies are severe talk to pet stores and adoption agencies in your region to see if they can help you find a new home for your guinea pig you should also make sure that any home your pet ends up in is safe by talking to the prospective buyer and asking about his or her previous pet ownership and animal care experience if you're experiencing allergies around a guinea pig there is a slight chance that it may not be the guinea pig itself causing your reactions an allergist can help you identify whether you're allergic to some environmental factor like hay straw used for the animal's bedding hay and straw often cause asthma like reactions including difficulty breathing increased production of mucus and congestion in the chest many people experience dermatitis symptoms as an allergic reaction to skin contact with hay straw dermatitis is usually characterized by red itchy or inflamed skin it may look like a rash on the skin usually at the point of exposure some people experience allergic reactions to wood shavings that are commonly used as guinea pig bedding talk to an allergist or try out a different bedding material that's free from any potential allergens even if wood shavings themselves aren't the problem many people experience allergies to the various coloring fragrances and oils added to guinea pig bedding eucalyptus oil and oil are common additives to guinea pig bedding make sure your wood shavings do not have any of these additives or try a different bedding material altogether if bedding isn't the issue there is a slight chance you may be allergic to the food you're feeding your guinea pig handling food or treats that contain an artificial color or other additives could be what's causing your reaction though only an allergist can confirm this for sure artificial coloring agents that begin with the letter e such as are commonly added to dried food and treats these coloring agents have produced allergic reactions in some individuals though again it's more likely that you're allergic to the animal itself or its bedding talk to an allergist

      "Question :  [\"monkey you own monkeys like to climb so provide a cage with plenty of height add branches hanging ropes and other features that will allow your monkey to climb around the cage most monkey owners allow their pets to spend time around the house rather than just in their cages monkeys are curious intelligent creatures that will get into everything available to them so you'll need to take the time to remove items that could cause them harm or suffer damage since monkeys can climb your monkey proofing will have to be more extensive than baby proofing would be don't let monkeys have access to anything with a cord make sure all electronics are out of their reach they'll tear down curtains knock over lamps and chew on furniture put away any items you aren't comfortable letting them destroy you might want to have one or two designated monkey rooms that the monkeys are allowed to play in and have the rest of the house be off limits remember that monkeys can turn and open windows so if you're planning to let the monkey stay there unsupervised you'll need to make sure the room is as secure as a cage would be with locks and bars on the windows monkeys keep their own bodies clean but they leave a mess wherever they go they aren't easy to house train and they whenever and wherever they choose some people put diapers on baby monkeys but this isn't usually possible once the monkeys mature rather you should plan on cleaning up after your monkey at least once a day to maintain sanitary conditions in the cage and in your home monkeys should always have access to fresh water that they drink from clean water bottles you can use baby bottles for this purpose some monkeys may prefer to take their water from a dish and some might like to have both options however you administer the water make sure there's no chance the monkey will run out monkey biscuits or commercial monkey food should be fed to your monkey every single day these biscuits contain the right combination of vitamins and minerals to meet your monkey's needs in addition to monkey biscuits monkeys enjoy cut up fruit and fresh or vegetables you may also feed your monkey grasshoppers mealworms cooked chicken with no spices hard boiled eggs yogurt rice grain and nuts do not feed your monkey anything that is considered junk food for a human sugary treats ice cream baked goods snack foods fast food and raw meat should never be fed to a monkey depending on the type of monkey you have you may also need to supplement his diet with extra vitamins monkeys kept inside may need extra vitamin d to account for the lack of sun exposure monkeys need a lot of variety and stimulation in order to be happy in the wild they spend most of their time climbing around trees and looking for food that experience in your monkey's cage and around the house by providing lots of interesting things for the monkey to play with and pull apart try hiding the monkey's food inside a box or in a container with small holes that the monkey can reach one hand into the monkey will have fun trying to figure out how to get to the food give the monkey stuffed animals balls and other toys to throw around and play with switch out the toys frequently so the monkey won't get bored monkeys are social creatures and when they're left alone for long periods of time they grow very unhappy spend a few hours playing with your monkey every single day as you bond with your monkey he'll start trusting you enough to climb up your body and give you hugs or even kisses if you have more than one monkey less social time is necessary many monkeys are happier living with others of their kind if you can afford more than one they'll live happily together in the same cage hitting or yelling at a monkey will cause him to become afraid of you it's also completely ineffective if you want to control your monkey's behavior remember that monkeys are wild and they simply can't be trained to do exactly what you want them to do from time to time they'll exhibit behaviors you might not like punishing them will only hurt your relationship the best way to deal with negative behaviors is to make sure the monkey isn't lacking something that he needs to be content does he have enough stimulation every day is he getting plenty of exercise are you playing with him enough monkeys that are afraid or agitated might bite from time to time again you can't deal with this by punishing the monkey instead get to know his moods and learn to leave him alone when he might be in the mood to bite it's not a good idea to take your monkey out in public or invite people to your home to play with him monkeys are too unpredictable your monkey can get taken away in an instant if an accident happens if your monkey so much as scratches someone an animal control has the right to confiscate him to test him for rabies when exotic animals are they are often euthanized since there is no law requiring a quarantine period for exotic animals as there is for domesticated animals like cats and dogs if you have to go out of town and leave the monkey in someone else's care make sure it's someone the monkey has met many times and has come to trust leaving the monkey with a total stranger could be stressful for him and lead to dangerous consequences say his name when you feed him or offer them a toy so he'll begin to learn it when he responds give him a treat and praise him teach him commands by showing him how to act for example if you say dance start hopping around and dancing when he learns a trick give him treats

      "Question :  [\"healthy mouth will make you more kissable having visibly dirty teeth and bad breath will likely keep people from wanting to kiss you make sure you brush twice each day and floss at least once it is good to get in this habit not only for your first kiss but for your own health as well have breath mints handy so you can toss one in your mouth if you end up eating or drinking before the time you plan to kiss the other person don’t chew gum although it will give you fresh breath having gum in your mouth during your first kiss can make it more difficult to enjoy the moment because you will have to worry about where the gum is in your mouth if your lips are chapped and dry the kiss will be less comfortable for both of you use a lip moisturizer such as vaseline regularly if you are a girl avoid sticky lip glosses the person kissing you may find it weird and if your lips are very sticky and messy this is probably the hardest part of any first kiss however if you want to kiss the person you are with look for signs that he or she wants to kiss you too often a good time is if you’ve been spending some time together alone having good conversation are they making a lot of eye contact obviously this doesn’t always mean they want to kiss you but if they make a lot of eye contact they at least find you interesting if they want to kiss you often they will be staring into your eyes or looking at your lips what does their body language say if they have their arms folded across their chest then they probably don’t want a kiss however if they have their body angled towards you are sitting or standing close to you with arms open then it’s likely a good bet remember that this moment could be planned or it could happen spontaneously try to stay calm and go with the flow there are certain moments where it is more likely for example if it is the end of the night just before you both go home or if you are alone in a quiet moment although it is ok to take a quick peek every now and then it is usually better to keep your eyes closed if your partner realizes you have your eyes open he she might feel uncomfortable it will also help you to relax if your eyes are closed when the kiss happens don’t immediately try to stick your tongue in his her mouth instead start out by gently kissing with just your lips and if the kiss continues to that proceed slowly there is no need to rush when it comes to kissing the worst thing you can do is to over think your first kiss remember that no matter what happens it is only one kiss and there will be many others once you get the first kiss out of the way you can practice getting better at it enjoy the moment you only get one first kiss and you will likely remember it for your entire life be present during the kiss don’t start thinking about how you can’t wait to tell your friends or write about it in your diary simply enjoy it think about why you want to experience your first kiss is it because you think you have to in order to be or is it because you feel that you actually want to have this experience there might be many reasons you want to experience your first kiss but in general it is a good idea to wait until you feel ready for it choose someone that you feel comfortable with and who wants to kiss you back typically this will be your boyfriend or girlfriend but in some cases it may also be a close friend who wants to have the experience too whoever it is it will be more enjoyable if it is someone you trust and feel comfortable with although the cutest girl or boy in school might be an obvious choice it doesn’t mean they are the best choice you should choose someone you find attractive on the inside as much as the outside ask trusted friends about their first kiss and how they prepared themselves ask them what advice they can give you if you feel comfortable doing so you can also discuss it with your parents don't be afraid to ask questions almost every one can remember the nervousness and worries they had before their first kiss it's likely that you will be worrying about all the things that could go wrong during your first kiss ignore these thoughts instead let yourself think only positive thoughts for example you can think about how you've taken good care of your lips and mouth making you very kissable you can think about how into you the person you will be kissing is and how romantic it will be although you will be nervous remember that you deserve to be kissed believe that the kiss will go well and although it may not go perfectly it will all be ok remember that even if it doesn't go perfectly it is only the first of many nearly everyone feels nervous when kissing someone for the first time this is a biological reaction to our excitement and doesn’t mean anything bad remember that this also goes for the person kissing you back it can sometimes be a comfort to remember the other person is also nervous if you do your best to act relaxed about the kiss it will help your partner relax too and you can both enjoy it often the first kiss will be everything you hoped it would be despite the fact that it didn't go perfectly however if things aren't turning out so well don't get angry instead pull away from your partner and smile it will help both of you relax and you can try again if you want to \\n\"]\n",

      "Question :  [\"when you love someone the other things in your life become a little less important in your mind if you love a guy you may find yourself thinking about him often — even when you don't really want to if he's the first thing on your mind when you wake up and the last thing you think of before you go to sleep this is a sign that you have serious feelings about him however infatuation puppy love can have the same effect since just thinking about someone often isn't enough to say whether you love that person use the other steps below to help make your decision the person you love shouldn't be someone you're shy around love means that you're extra comfortable around this guy — you like hanging out with him because he makes you feel like you can be yourself on the other hand if this guy still makes you feel nervous antsy or insecure your relationship may not have made it to love territory yet if you still get the butterflies around this guy don't worry you can eventually love him — you just need to spend more time together and grow more confident around each other people who love each other tend to enjoy thinking about the rich rewarding time they've already spent together if you sit down and think of the things you've done together do you find yourself feeling warm happy or nostalgic emotions if so you may have a good foundation for love if you don't feel an attachment to your memories together you may not be there yet if you don't have any memories together you probably haven't spent enough time with this guy for love to develop it's natural to have some fantasies of the future when you have a crush — running off together to a tropical retreat exploring the world etc however when you love someone your fantasies tend to be a little more realistic you may find yourself thinking things like i wonder if we can live together when we finish school i wonder whether we could get a dog together and so on if so this can be a sign that you are excited for a realistic future with your partner which is evidence for love the person you love should make you happy most of the time when you're together if he can cheer you up no matter how angry you are this is an even better sign if you find yourself smiling whenever he is around this is best of all your smile should be open and genuine not forced a friend can help you see whether you smile around him or not tell your friend to watch your face when you're hanging out him in a group then give yourself a few minutes to forget you told your friend to do this if your friend notices your face light up whenever he talks to you you may be feeling something for this guy loving someone usually means they will naturally work their way into your conversations simply because you're thinking about them so much if you find yourself gushing about the latest with this guy even when the conversation has nothing to do with him you definitely have an attachment to him you can ask your friends to help you here — ask them whether they notice you talking about him a lot for obvious reasons this isn't a good choice if you tend to get shy when talking about romance in this case you may avoid talking about your relationship even if you do love him so use the other recommendations in this article today the internet gives people who are in love plenty of opportunities to check on each other if you are constantly checking this guy's facebook twitter aim instagram etc to get the latest updates or catch a new you have at least a serious crush even things as simple as checking to see if your guy will be online to talk to every night can be signs of attachment of course this on its own isn't a sign of love looking at someone's profile pics every night may simply mean you think he's good looking so use this tip along with the others in the article to get a complete picture of how you feel about him the way you carry yourself around your guy when you're hanging out with other people can help tell you whether you love him or not if you find yourself focusing on everything he says or snapping to attention whenever he opens his mouth you may have serious feelings for him if you find yourself more interested in what he has to say than what anyone else does this is an even better sign being in love with a guy means valuing him for what comes out of his mouth instead of just the way he looks when he's talking as noted at the top of this article when you're in love with someone everything else seems a little less important if you find that you want to spend time with this guy even when you have lots of other male friends he's definitely important to you you may even have multiple crushes and prioritize this guy over the rest it's ok to find multiple people charming or attractive — just date one at a time this doesn't mean that the more time you spend with someone the more you love that person even if you love this guy however you shouldn't spend all

      "Question :  [\"to know you too once you're talking regularly try to look for shared interests to discuss this way you'll get to know each other better and bond through common traits for example say you find out you both like dancing with the stars try asking him about the latest episodes after they air for example did you see dancing with the stars last night it was so crazy from there you can look for broader topics of shared interests to discuss for example do you like dancing i just love dancing and if a conversation is down ask a question asking someone about themselves will usually keep a conversation interesting this will also give you a sense of whether you want to eventually ask your crush out if you have a lot of shared interests and opinions you're more likely to be compatible you can ask questions like what's your favorite movie do you have any hobbies what's your favorite subjects in school what's the coolest place you've ever visited who's your favorite television character when you really like someone it can be very tempting to try and be the type of person you think they would be interested in dating for instance if the guy is really sporty but you could care less about sports you might be tempted to pretend you're also a big fan avoid this don't deny your own interests hobbies and friends out of fear of judgement or rejection you can be polite about it oh i'm not really into football and use it as an opportunity to help him learn a little about you i actually really love going to see live music it can be hard to keep this in mind when you are crushing hard but remember that someone who doesn't like you for who you really are ultimately isn't a good match for you if you get his number texting can be a great form of communication that can help you get to know him better try to text him once in awhile and see how he responds this can help you see if he likes you as well a guy who texts back eagerly is more likely to be interested be yourself when you text if he asks you questions give honest answers use your own unique voice and sense of humor throw in an occasional emoji don't overdo it but a few smiley faces now and then can come off as flirty allow him to initiate texting on occasion you don't want to overwhelm him as you're getting to know a guy try to do some light flirting this will convey your interest and allow you to get a sense of whether a guy likes you if he flirts back it's likely he's interested smile smiling is contagious keeping eye contact while smiling is key this keeps the tension in the air flirty and fun a smile to a guy gives him motivation to pursue you give him a brief smile and then look away make eye contact this will convey interest try to introduce gentle touch lightly brush his arm when you're talking to him for example some topics can tank a conversation so they should be avoided if you're trying to get to know a potential romantic interest stay away from topics that may make him uncomfortable avoid putting yourself down you want to show that you like yourself and you're not insecure never say anything negative about his friends or family before you ask someone out it's a good idea to see if they're interested as well if the guy doesn't seem at all invested it may be a good idea to stick to being friends a guy who's interested will often show this in his body language he will lean towards you when he talks make eye contact and smile frequently people often subtly mirror one another's body language when they're interested in someone a guy may for example cross his legs when you do if a guy makes excuses to touch you this is a sign of attraction he may brush your arm give you a hug or try to touch you in other ways it may also help to notice if he acts different around you then he does other people this may suggest he likes you and may even go against the normal signs for instance if he is usually very flirty with just about everyone but is more quiet and shy around you this may actually be because he is nervous around you keep in mind that none of these are definite signs he is interested sometimes it's best just to be straightforward it can be scary to confess your feelings however if you think the guy is interested it's easier to just come out and say so instead of beating around the bush keep it simple say something like so i really like you a lot i was wondering if you feel the same way take a few deep breaths before going into the conversation this will help you stay calm if it goes well ask the guy out on a date say something like do you want to see a movie tonight or do you want to go to the school dance with me it can be hard to make the first move but if your feelings are shared that's somewhat easier you can never be 100 sure if someone is interested in you even if you think you've read the signs correctly there's always a chance a guy will not return your affections if this is the case try to accept this and move on if the guy turns you down don't question him or get angry say something like oh ok i'm disappointed but i understand then you can excuse yourself and walk away seek out support from friends and family members find someone to vent your disappointment towards do something nice for yourself in the wake of disappointment buy yourself a new item of clothing or other treat take a day off to watch a movie with a friend \\n\"]\n",

      "Question :  ['when you see your crush grab his gaze and hold it smile at him hold that look for a few seconds and then look away repeat it again and if he’s interested he’ll mirror your cues use the flick technique meet his eyes let your gaze fall to his mouth and then lift them so that your eyes meet his again pair that with a coy grin when you know he’s watching you play with your hair a little this lets him know that you notice him noticing you fake it till you make it the more you allow yourself to relax into the situation and feel comfortable with it the more confident you will seem confidence is an for men so use it generously don’t fidget with or hide your hands as its often a sign of nervousness place them on your hips or leave them out in the open to promote better posture and signal to him that you are open keep your chin up and eyes level at all times even as you walk to project confidence take care of your appearance groom with products that leave you smelling good and feeling good like conditioners lotions fragrances etc pay attention to the details he’ll remember you from your back and forth looks comment about something in class or make a joke this takes the pressure off an initial one on one encounter and can feel a lot more organic than the individual approach attempt if you’re feeling brave approach him directly if not make approaching him more comfortable by setting the scene the setup will provide the icebreaker you need to get the conversation going bump into him and apologize frantically place your hand in your hair and laugh at yourself for running into him drop something like a book or a pen as you walk past him he will either run after you to return it to you or you can retrieve it yourself and explain that you are clumsy this will always be the move because it’s direct straightforward and lacks the presence of games the simplest thing to say is “hi i’m what’s your name ”if in person introductions intimidate you create an indirect approach to introducing yourself add him on facebook or instagram message him directly by giving your name and telling him where he might know you from school or work tell him you have noticed him from afar and have been dying to talk to him and let him know your name direct message him on twitter introducing yourself as his classmate or coworker use your shyness to your advantage by saying that he makes you so shy in person that twitter messaging became the next best thing to hello get his number from a mutual friend this one is a little risky because a lot of people do not like to have their numbers handed out if it is not from them directly but if you make up a good excuse you might be able to make this move work in your favor apologize for having his number and tell him that you missed notes in class heard he would have them and really need it to study for an upcoming test this looks more proactive less crazy so if you’re going to text him make sure you have a reason and take the conversation from there light topics will always be easier to upon into deeper topics later ask about the weather or ask if he went to the school’s last game ask him how he’s doing today or what he’s up to ”what kind of day are you having ””what are you studying do you work ””what are you doing later ” ask questions that are open ended and lead to him describing his likes and dislikes his passions and his interests listen to his responses more than you speak ”what kind of movies do you like what are your favorites ””what do you like to read in your spare time ””what is the most beautiful place you’ve ever been do you plan to travel to this year one thing that you’re really really good at ” men like praise and appreciation as much as women do the act itself puts into words your interest in him slip into the conversation organically and limit the compliments to a couple at a time if he smiles while you’re talking “you have an incredible smile ”if he laughs at something funny “your laugh is music ”if he has a great sense of humor “you are really funny ”if you like what he’s wearing “you have really great style ”if you want to mention his looks but not directly wait for him to do something that’s cute like talking about a hobby passionately “you’re so cute ” make things feel less formal and less like an interview by making conversation a two way street if he asks questions about you because he’s interested and wants to know more answer honestly and confidently connect a shared passion or interest with a personal story to deepen the emotional connection between you two allow him to get to know who you are and decide if he likes what he likes stare in his eyes intensely use body language to show him your interest touch him lightly on the arm or accidentally touch his leg knees or feet with yours now that has been made with creating a foundation for friendship see if there’s more there by hanging out one on one in a more intimate setting connection continues to build the more you bond through shared activities grab a bite to eat somewhere just the two of you find a less pressured date setting by going hiking or doing something

them stand with your feet shoulder width apart hands on your hips shoulders back this wonder woman pose can actually change your chemistry making you feel more confident more likely to take risks and better able to cope with stress it can be as simple as saying hey when you pass them in the halls or asking them what the homework was you forgot to write it down these little moments will make talking to your crush seem normal and not so scary don't listen to advice that tells you to fake interest in your crush's passions instead find out which passions you both share this can help your crush and will also give you an easy way to start a conversation with them if you're obsessed with the same band and you can speak about them with confidence it might make it easier to talk to your crush without stuttering feeling nervous or not knowing what to say use this as a jumping off point to ask your crush about themselves people love to talk about themselves and usually think favorably about someone who asks them questions and listens ask if your crush has ever seen the band live or which songs are their favorite finding out your common interests can also be a good way to lead up to asking out your crush if you both love soccer maybe you crush will want to join you and your friends if you're still nervous at a match over the weekend if you have a trusted friend who knows about your crush she might be able to take some of the pressure off your interactions knowing you have someone in your corner can help you feel a little calmer and more confident make sure you trust your friend not to embarrass you if you have a friend who can sometimes be a little mean or likes to tease you then telling her about your crush might not be the best idea she might think it's funny to try and make you blush or even tell your crush how you feel panicking screaming yelling or blaming someone else for what happened will become the true embarrassing moment whether someone spilled your secret or you accidentally walked into a wall right in front of your crush keeping a level head will help you get out of the situation with as much grace and dignity as possible taking a deep breath can go a long way in calming you down try to inhale for four seconds then exhale for four seconds as you are breathing think about what you will say instead of blurting out something defensive so you just fell in front of the whole school at the pep rally get up dust yourself off and laugh say something like wow that was embarrassing and keep going if you're able to laugh at yourself you'll take the tension out of the moment and may even appear to be confident people are more likely to be forgiving of those who own up to their mistakes if you acknowledge that you said or did something embarrassing there might be a little teasing but people will be more likely to let it go even if you can't laugh about it in the moment try making a joke out of it later it will show you don't take yourself too seriously you may be replaying an embarrassing moment over and over in your mind the dumb joke you told in front of your crush that fell flat but chances are you are the only one people often aren't paying as close attention us as we may imagine and tend to judge others more on overall character than one embarrassing incident it's likely your crush didn't even notice the thing you're over or if they did it probably wasn't as bad as you think obsessing over a moment in the past can be destructive and does little other than make you feel sad and angry if there's something to learn from the incident like to pause and think before you speak then take that lesson and let the rest go remember that everyone gets embarrassed each and every person from the president to your crush has been embarrassed don't run before you can walk practice making conversation and even flirting with others before approaching your crush this doesn't mean leading someone on but flirting a little with someone less intimidating than your crush can boost your self esteem and make flirting less nerve wracking try approaching people you think are cute and asking them for the time build up to striking up little conversations with strangers stop putting yourself down and start replacing negative thoughts with affirmations it might be hard to believe but if you start telling yourself you are a smart interesting and kind person who deserves respect you will start to believe it cutting out negative thinking and building yourself up can increase your self confidence remember that everyone struggles with self esteem issues everyone has flaws they are worrying about everyone feels low or like they're not good enough at some time in their lives in fact most people are probably so busy worrying about their own flaws that they don't have time to notice yours do things that make you feel good about yourself exercise and eat right wear clothes that make you feel comfortable and confident filling your day with things you find interesting will help you take your mind off your crush and remind you that you are an amazing person with a lot to offer it can also help expose you to new people with shared interests and you can get to know them and further develop your social skills doing interesting things will make you more interesting don't just talk about how you want to join the

      "Question :  ['tease all of his friends too then he won’t see that he’s special to you your crush will suspect that you like him if you start helping him out you don’t need to go too far out of your way to help him but making just a few small gestures can show him that you really do have a special interest in him this can mean picking up his homework for him when he’s home sick letting him borrow a textbook or answering some questions that he may have this can be a great way to show him you care as long as he doesn’t take advantage of you ideally he should find a way to help you out too you don’t want him to think that you’ll just be there at his and call look for ways that you can help him he may be too shy to do something like ask for him with the math homework but you can offer to do it and see what he says flirting will definitely let your crush know that you’re into him to flirt with him you just have to tease him a bit be playful and show a special interest in him over all of the other guys in the room you can play a little bit hard to get while letting him see that you do like him by smiling at him laughing at his jokes and going out of your way to make him see that you want to spend more time with him flirting can be a little tricky to master but it basically means not taking yourself too seriously while you chat about lighthearted topics with your crush letting him see that you want to know what he has to say while also teasing him a little bit you can lick your lips or play with your hair a bit while you talk to your crush to be a bit more playful if you do want your crush to know how much you like him you should make sure to tell him yourself even if you do it in a letter while having your friends tell your crush how you feel may be easier it will make you look like you’re not ready for a mature relationship or like you don’t feel comfortable talking to him yourself even if he does say that he likes you back this won’t start your relationship off on the right foot plus you don’t want him to feel annoyed by all of your friends surrounding him respect his privacy and tell him about your feelings yourself if you’re too afraid to tell your crush you like him in person then one thing you can do is to write him a short note or a longer letter letting him know how you feel you can slide it into his locker or hand it to him tell him that you like him give him a reason or two why if you want and ask if he returns your feelings this is a great way to directly tell him how you feel while taking off some of the pressure of having to do it in person keep it short and sweet you don’t want to go into too much detail about how you like him without knowing whether or not he returns your feelings you can tell him the best way to contact you either by telling him where he can leave his response or by giving him your number another way to tell him that you like him is to give him a call and simply to tell him how you feel yeah this technically means telling him how you feel with words but if you find that telling him without words hasn’t been working for you then it may be time to come out with it give him a call take a deep breath and quickly tell him how you feel and ask him if he returns your feelings you’ll have your answer before you know it just say something like “i’ve had a lot of fun hanging out with you for the past few weeks and i want you to know that i like you i wanted to know if you shared my feelings ” if the idea of calling him to tell him your feelings doesn’t feel quite right then you may just have to pick the right time and place to have the conversation in person just ask him if he can meet you in a place where you can be alone make eye contact and simply tell him how you feel give him some time to react and respond and try not to put the pressure on him keep things lighthearted instead of sounding intense you can make a bit of small talk to make him comfortable but don’t be afraid to jump in and share your feelings you can give him a small compliment or two while you say that you like him you can say something like can make me laugh like you to show why you like him once your crush knows you like him he’ll either say he shares your feelings or will want to stay friends if he says he likes you too then you can celebrate and get excited to start a relationship with him if he doesn’t feel the same way however it’s important to stay mature and to keep things positive instead of getting emotional or making him feel bad for not feeling the same way though you will be upset you should make it seem like it’s not a big deal and then be sad about it once you’re away from your crush no matter what happens you want to leave a good impression if you start calling him names or being mean to him for not sharing your feelings that will take you down a dark path even if he doesn’t share your feelings he’ll respect you for being open and honest with him you should be proud of yourself for putting yourself out there and making an effort \\n']\n",

you like her enough to put thought into your writing hi what's up is the math homework destroying you as badly as it's destroying me looks a lot better than hi is the math killing u 2 most people are more relaxed in the evening following a busy day at school or work you’ll have more time to respond to each other’s thoughts this way plus communicating with her at night can feel more romantic than telling her you like her in broad daylight make sure not to text after bedtime which can feel invasive wind down the texts after 10 pm or so you want to be able to give your full attention to the conversation and you want her to be able to give you attention too this means that it's best not to text her when she's told you about other plans if she’s told you that she’s going out with friends for instance give her a little space you can always text her tomorrow and ask how her girl's night out went it works the other way too don’t text her right before a movie if you know you’ll be distracted the more upbeat and positive the conversation the more receptive a girl will be when you tell her you like her try to stay away from negative topics that can ruin the mood such as problems at school or work or controversial subjects that can upset her and turn conversation sour talk about pop culture you have in common if you’re both giant ask how she feels about the new movie trailer joke about something in your daily life you both share if the school lunch was an ask if she’s having about it too this shows you’re a good listener and that you care and that you pay attention to everything she shares with you for example if she once mentioned that she likes bowling ask about her highest score or favorite this is often more effective than telling a girl you like her because it shows you understand her and recognize her best qualities for example if you like her knowledge of tell her that you learn something new about the x men every time you talk to her avoid complimenting your crush’s physical characteristics like her body or eyes at this stage it can come off as creepy if your crush has recently a performance or other big event congratulate her on her skills texting is fun but too much of it can become really intense if you’re texting your crush for several hours a day it might be time to dial it back a bit this is especially true if you seem to be putting more effort into your texts than she is if you text your crush twice and she doesn’t respond back off for a while if she’s into you she’ll text you again when she’s ready don’t go too far in the other direction and never text her back you may be trying to play it cool but if she feels ignored she’ll feel bad you don’t need to write yourself a perfect script but take a little time and figure out when and how to tell your crush that you’re into her if you think ahead a little bit you’re less likely to fumble and forget yourself or blurt out something too intense “i’ve had a crush on you for seven years ” consider that it’s often better to ask someone on a clearly defined date this way you’re telling her that you like her and giving her an opportunity for an action plan know how you’ll deal if you’re rejected rejection happens to everyone and it’s not the end of the world it’s easiest to say something like “thank you for telling me i enjoy hanging out with you as friends so no worries ” take a bit of space then return to the friendship after a couple weeks this is a confident indirect way to tell a girl you like her without actually saying you like her send this text after hanging out together or even after an official date say something like “i had fun with you tonight and enjoyed your company can’t wait to do it again ” be simple and direct this shows that you’re confident and feel strongly enough about your feelings that you’re willing to admit it word for word make your statement more personal by sharing what you like most about her for example say “i’m into you because you're so passionate about social justice ” or “i like you because you're sunny enough to brighten anyone's day like when you’re complimenting a girl mention something specific about her personality that you like tell her that she cracks you up whenever you hang out or that her commitment to saving the environment is powerful and cool now that you’ve laid your feelings bare you probably want to take your relationship a step further by dating the only way to date a girl is of course to go on a date with her after you’ve told her you like her invite her on an outing for just the two of you make it clear that it’s not a “group hang” or a casual thing it’s a real date when you’re asking someone out always suggest a specific date and time say something like want to get deep dish and see the school play friday night this way if she likes you but can’t make it she’ll reschedule if she’s not interested it’ll be a lot easier on your feelings to hear “i’m sorry i can’t make it” then “i don’t feel that way about you the date around things you both like if you’re both into mini golf and ask want to go to my favorite range on after school we can stop by the diner for after

      "Question :  ['his feet checking his phone or looking around for a friend who can give him a save then you can shift subjects by asking him a question instead learn to read body language and facial expressions to see whether or not a guy is listening to you if he’s listening he’ll be making eye contact unless he’s super shy or has a crush on you and turning his body toward you instead of away one thing you can do is to offer a subtle compliment to a guy from time to time you don’t have to tell him he has the world’s most beautiful eyes or that he’s a big but you can compliment a new shirt the guy is wearing tell him he did great in yesterday’s basketball game or just make a kind lighthearted comment that lets the guy know you care you don’t have to actually have a crush on the guy to give him a compliment either you can say something like “you’re so good at chemistry how do you do it ” or “you have such a unique laugh i could tell it was you from the other side of the hall ” if you want to have a good time hanging out with guys then you should ask them about themselves from time to time without them you can get to know them little by little and show that you care about the things that matter to them you don’t need to interview them but you should ask them a question or two in the course of a conversation here are some things you can ask them about to show them you care their favorite favorite tv shows movies or weekend pets guys like girls who don’t take themselves too seriously while it’s not attractive to actually put yourself down or to make fun of yourself in a real way like saying that you’re fat that you’re stupid or that you hate something about yourself some light humor can show that you’re a fun easygoing person this is different from bad yourself in hopes that someone will give you some attention just learn to laugh at yourself and the rest of your life will be much easier for example you can make a comment like surprise i tripped again ” or “i wonder how many more pink sweaters i can wear ” to show guys that you’re aware of your goofy or endearing qualities while not being committed to perfection if you would describe yourself as a girly girl like to wear dresses and emphasize your feminine qualities then you should keep doing that but if you’re more of a tomboy then you should be proud to be who you are and not try to giggle more than usual play with your hair more than usual or just change who you are to be more girly because you think that’s what guys want the most important thing is that you act like yourself and guys will be impressed you can also mix it up if you’re more of a tomboy but want to put on a dress or a skirt once in a while no one is stopping you if you have a crush on a guy and have something to say to him about it then make sure you do it yourself sure it’s easier and less stressful to have one of your friends talk to the guy for you to tell him what you’re thinking but if you do it yourself you’ll start an easier flow of communication and the guy will be impressed by your confidence the worst that can happen is that he may not return your feelings but at least you’ll have the satisfaction of knowing that you had the courage to talk to him to begin with if you’re really shy about telling a guy you like him in person you can pass him a note or talk to him online the most important thing is that it’s coming from you directly again another girls have about how to act around guys is that they want girls who are laughing all the time of course if the guy you’re around is genuinely funny you can laugh all you want but you should avoid laughing if you’re doing it only because you think it’ll make people like you more you can laugh but you should also have jokes of your own to share too you don’t want people to think you’re just a laugh track when a guy is genuinely funny you can crack up all you want but you should avoid doing it just because you think it makes you look cute you may also think that guys like girls who talk about how much money their purse cost which celebrities are following them on twitter or other things that may make you more interesting instead talk about the things you actually care about and guys will be impressed if you do something that is worth bragging about then the guys will find out some other way because other people will be praising you just work on being the best person you can be and guys will be impressed by what you do whether you’re amazing at learning foreign or have an unstoppable tennis serve you may think that guys will think it’s funny if you put other girls down or talk about the random drama you’re experiencing however most guys actually prefer girls who are chill and who don’t complain about their friends and who don’t feel the need to put other people down just to feel better about themselves if you actually say nice things about girls who aren’t there and avoid gossip guys will like you more because they’ll see that you’re easygoing and drama free and will be drawn to you if you put down other girls then it’ll be a sign of your insecurity and guys will see that you’re only doing it to try to make yourself look better instead praise other girls to show how comfortable you are with what you have to offer \\n']\n",

      "Question :  [\"or at his sides if so then he wants to give you all of his attention see how he touches other girls does he put his arm around every girl or only you see if he ever gently pats your hand even when he’s joking this is a very intimate gesture and it may show that he really likes you he may just be a really good friend or all of those favors he's doing for you may mean something more notice all of the things he does for you and think about what they mean here's how to tell see if he's being very thoughtful does he bring you coffee when you're having an intense study session or get tickets for a movie you hinted that you want to see if so then he's probably hanging on to your every word and just wants to make you happy see if he does nice things for everyone is he just mr nice guy and loves giving rides and buying lunch for everyone in town or does he do these things for only you remember if he likes you then he'll treat you differently than everybody else if he helps you out with your chores like doing your laundry then he definitely wants to be your boyfriend if he offers to help you with your car he's not just being friendly he wants you to be impressed by his manliness you need to check out how he talks to other girls to see if he treats them just like he treats you or if he thinks you're special to him you don't have to stare or stalk to get a sense of how he treats others and to have a sense of where you stand with him see if he's a perpetual flirt does he flirt with every girl in the room or only you remember he may still like you if he flirts with other girls but it makes it less likely that he's singling you out you can also look for the opposite sign does he flirt with every girl except for you then maybe he’s not flirting with you because you’re the only one he really likes he may respect you too much to tease or flirt with you like he does with every other girl does he seem embarrassed or shy if he hangs out with a new girlfriend in front of you if so then he may not want you to see his relationship unfolding because rather be with you see if the other girls he hangs out with know who you are if he’s with another girl and she gives you an “oh i’ve heard about you” look then the girl may be jealous because you’re important to the guy if he likes you then he’ll want to be around you as much as possible he could try to do this in subtle and not so subtle ways here are a few signs that he wants to be around you because he sees you as more than a friend if he acts like you’re the only person in the room when you’re hanging out in big groups if you’re at a party concert or a bar and you realize you ended up talking to him for most of the night then he definitely wants to get closer to you if you have a class together and he always tries to sit next to you and even saves you a seat then he may want to take things to the next level notice if he sometimes just happens to run into you in your favorite coffee shop or bar if he’s always around then he may have a stalking problem but if he’s just the occasionally then it may be because he’s hoping to run into you paying attention to how and how often you hang out and to when and where you hang out can give you great insight into whether he just wants to see you ask a friend or if he wants all of your hang sessions to be more like dates here are some points to consider notice where you hang out do you see him in romantic locations like gardens nicer wine bars or places where you see couples hanging out for date nights if so then he may want the same for you notice who is around when you hang out if it’s always just the two of you then he may see you as crush material but if he’s always inviting ten of his closest bros along then he may see you just as another friend notice when you hang out if you only see him once a month then he may not be trying to spend more time with you but if it feels like you haven’t gone more than a day without seeing him recently then yeah he probably likes you notice what you do when you hang out going out for coffee or a quick lunch is more meant for the friend zone but going out for dinner or seeing a movie in the evening is a more than friend activity this may feel like a no brainer but it may be harder to tell if he’s flirting with you than you think every guy has his own flirting style and there will be a variety of ways to flirt with you to show that he definitely likes you here are a few signs that he’s flirting if he’s always trying to make you laugh if you have a class together and even in the margins of your notes then he’s definitely flirting with you if he sends you a lot of emoticons when he’s texting then he’s flirting with you if he’s always playfully hitting you or giving you a gentle shove then he’s flirting with you if he loves you underwater when you’re in a pool then he is definitely flirting if he’s always trying to make you laugh or giggle then he’s

      "Question :  [\"continuing the conversation sometimes just going with your gut can bring out your most confident self once you have established a good connection with your crush you should start trying to get to know him or her better start with something that he or she has mentioned or that you have observed in your interactions for example “i see you have some books with you what are you reading ” this is a low pressure question that lets your crush know you are interested in him or her then ask follow up questions for example if he or she is excited to talk about the books ask more questions make connections related to the books for example “that is cool that you are reading that book my favorite book by that author is blank ”or if he or she doesn't seem too excited about his or her books you can move onto something else more open ended say something like “so what else are you up to this week ” avoid bring up topics of conversation that show that you already know about your interests because that might make you feel awkward for example if you know he plays soccer avoid bringing that up directly don’t say “so tell me about your soccer season ” instead let the conversation get there naturally your crush will enjoy him herself in a conversation with you much more if you are a good listener once you have started conversation you should be face to face or in a listening position where you hear and see his or her face easily another key part of active listening is making consistent but not constant eye contact during your conversation avoid distractions don’t send a text or look at your phone while you talk this will make it seem like you are disinterested and might keep you from really hearing what your crush is saying repeat the main idea of what your crush is saying this will let him or her know that you are listening and will give him or her the chance to clarify anything repeat the most meaningful parts of what he or she is saying for example you can say “so are you saying that you are new to painting but it feels like you have been doing it forever ” this will help him or her feel connected to you because you show that you understand important things about him or her avoid interrupting him or her in conversation it is easy to get excited by what we want to say and interrupt during his or her turn in the conversation but resist the temptation and wait until he or she has finished talking and then show your enthusiasm for what he or she is saying be empathetic if your crush talks about something hard that is going on with him or her make sure you don’t skip over his or her feelings in the conversation you could say in response to him or her talking about failing a test something like “i could understand why it would be really frustrating to have to retake that test ” one way to keep a conversation friendly and natural is if you seem like you are having a good time talking with him or her a few ways you can show this if you make eye contact smile often laugh lean forward slightly when you are talking and use open body language use any gestures when you talk that are natural for you and keep your arms open and not crossed tilting your head to one side is another good way to show friendliness playfulness when you are talking and flirting this is good to do around the three quarter point into your conversation it is a good idea to suggest getting together or getting his or her number after you have made solid connections and before the conversation has become tired or worn out think about a couple of activities that would be right for you both before you have a conversation say something like “you are really cool would you want to hang out sometime ” then suggest a couple of things you can do together and get his or her number or if you want to play it safer you can simply ask “hey can i have your number i have really enjoyed talking to you ”if you feel like the conversation was just okay you can always wait for a couple more conversations through texting or in person before asking to him or her to hang out you might want to talk to your crush about something he or she talked about at the beginning of the conversation for example you can say “so how much longer do you think you need to spend on your paper ” and then spend the rest of the conversation finishing talking about the points of conversation you have already started you can make inside jokes about what you talked about for example you can say “well now that we have made it through this lunch period without water i suppose we can get through anything together inside jokes can help you cement connections you have made and it is a good way to make your connection last past the first conversation when you are feeling good and you have just finished laughing about something you should politely end your conversation so that your crush is left with a good impression make sure to tell him or her that you enjoyed your conversation you can keep the end of your conversation casual you can say something like “i should be getting home now but i had a lot of fun talking to you ”if you are going to be seeing your crush in the future you should say something about seeing him or her again say “i look forward to seeing you in class and hearing how your paper turned out a follow up text in the next couple of days saying hello and

      "Question :  [\"impressed one of the biggest mistakes guys make is to spend so much time talking about themselves or worrying about themselves that they never stop and realize that there’s a girl standing in front of them you may even make the innocent mistake of thinking too hard about what to say to impress a girl to have the time to consider what she’s saying to you that stops now instead take the time to really listen to her to let her finish talking instead of interrupting and to make an effort to really understand what she’s trying to say instead of trying to relate everything back to yourself it’s really hard for girls to find a good listener if you can be a good listener this will definitely make you stand out as someone who genuinely cares for her a little bit of flirting can go a long way if you want to get the ladies then you have to know how to flirt with them without going over the top just be fun and light and playful making harmless jokes and teasing them a little bit and keep the conversation and banter going in a fun lighthearted way don’t make overly sexual comments or insult the girl when you’re really just trying to tease her instead give her cute compliments and even laugh at yourself a little bit to make her see that you like her and don’t take the whole flirting thing too seriously of course if you want one special girl you should give her most of your flirting energy while occasionally flirting with others to keep it interesting you don’t want her to think that you’re just a big flirt who flirts with everybody and doesn’t really care about her if you want the girl to go crazy over you then it helps a lot if her friends think you’re the best thing since sliced bread if you’re only nice to the girl you like and are kind of mean to the rest of her friends then she’ll get word of it and will think that you don’t really care about people but if you charm her friends without flirting with them or giving them the wrong idea then she’ll get word of how nice of a guy you are and will undoubtedly like you even more when girls hear other girls talking about how awesome a guy is then they get jealous which makes them like that guy even more if you want a girl to go crazy for you then you have to make her feel special by actually taking the time to recognize her as a unique individual tell her “you’re not like other or “you’re so different from your and make her see that she really does stand out to you you can give her a specific compliment about her personality or mention something she said in a previous conversation to show that you’re listening and that you do care don’t do this to every girl though or it will get back to her and it’ll look like you’re just a player girls want to feel unique and if they can find a guy who makes them feel that way they’ll be all in take the time to really notice the things that make the girl stand out whether it’s her confidence her laugh or her talent at dancing let her know why she’s special though you want to win the girl over you have to keep up the chase you don’t want her to think that she has you in the palm of her hand but that she has to do some work to win you over too it should be a mutual thing let her know you like her but don’t shower her with compliments hang out with her but make sure you have plans with other friends too and that you aren’t available the second she wants to hang out if she calls you stop picking up the second the phone rings you’ve got other things to do right this will keep the girl interested in coming back for more this doesn’t mean that you have to play elaborate games to win the girl over it does mean that you should keep things interesting so there’s never a dull moment when she sees you if you put it all out there she’ll be less likely to be crazy about the intriguing awesome guy that you are you don't want to become that obsessive possessive guy every girl is afraid of but you also don't want to be mr aloof whether you're in a relationship with a girl or just starting to hang out texting her every once in a while to ask how her day is going or to ask how her math test or soccer game went will show that you're thinking about her even when you're not together this will make her see that you're a guy worth keeping around just make sure that you're not always the one to check in first or she may feel a bit smothered don't text her to say hi more than once every other day or so you don't want her to think that you have nothing better to do than to be in touch with her the best way to win a girl over is not to rush it and just to enjoy the moment instead of trying to find the best fifty ways to be the coolest guy ever as corny as it sounds at the end of the day you want the girl to like you not some overdone fake version of who you are so you should focus on having the girl get to know the real you and getting to know the real her in the process if you spend all your time trying to impress the girl trying to play hard to get or generally behaving in a way that just doesn't feel natural to you then she'll catch on pretty fast instead relax charm the girl and get ready for her to go crazy for you \\n\"]\n",

telling you don't try to solve her problems or give an opinion on everything just be there and listen when she wants to talk demonstrate that you are listening by what she said and checking to see if you are understanding for example you could say something like “if i’m understanding you correctly you are feeling frustrated about your boss and the way she handles meetings is that right ”ask

best and she continues to enjoy the way that you look you have to keep taking care of yourself make sure that you eat well exercise daily and get plenty of rest and relaxation if you really want her to fall in love with you and to stay that way then you always have to keep making the effort you've got to bring her flowers on random days you should dress up for date nights come up with new things to do together never give up on trying to make her laugh don't quit on her if she's in a bad mood just keep working your charms and working hard to keep her don't think that once you've both said you love each other you've got this in the bag you always have to keep making an effort whether you're 20 30 or 80 assess your relationship every so often to see what has changed or what needs to change

your favorite tv show with you if it's not her thing having your own interests that you maintain will help you grow stronger too while you should work on doing things together it's important to stay focused on your own goals and pursuits too if you're always together one or both of you may begin to feel smothered keep on doing the things you love while making time for the person you love try setting aside a day or night where you spend time with your friends and she spends time with hers if you want to make a woman fall for you and make it last forever then you have to tell her that you love her do it at least once a day and say it like you really mean it these three words can make a big impact on your life and your relationship no matter how secure a woman is in her relationship she

      "Question :  [\"person likes you or not even if they haven't they'll probably be better at guessing than you are that's only because when it's you in the situation you have a harder time stepping back and analyzing it and you may feel a little self conscious thinking about a girl liking you therefore asking a good friend can help you analyze the situation better one way to see if a girl likes you is to watch how she treats you on social media of course you first need to friend her once you do watch how she interacts with you if she seems to pay extra attention to you she may like you for instance maybe she likes everything you post or tags you in a number of her posts for instance if she writes cute on a you posted it may be she's flirting with you if a girl likes you she's going to find reasons to be near you even if you've never talked to her you'll look up and she'll be at the next table in the library or a few down at the basketball game it's not that she's stalking you rather she's probably hoping you'll notice her this approach may include things like walking through your line of sight or talking to people near you if you're trying to figure out if someone likes you by analyzing everything she does she may not be that into you if someone likes you you'll generally know it in your gut with the exception of very shy people however if you're not sure it's always best to give it a shot by talking to her the worst she can say is no if you notice that she seems to go up and talk to everyone but avoids talking to you she may just be nervous about talking to you in other words she doesn't talk to you because she likes you and that makes her scared another step you could take is to talk to one of her friends particularly if you have a class with one of them a simple hey you're friend right can i ask you something do you think jess likes me is really all you need you can also watch how her friends react when you're around the whole group of them including the girl you like for instance they may start whispering to each other teasing the girl or even pushing her in your direction see if she wants to keep your attention or if her eyes move away from yours if she is consistently making eye contact and sometimes blushing while doing it chances are she’s interested in you she may also try stealing quick glances at you when she thinks you're not looking of course you don't want to just stare at her because that will come off as creepy just glance in her direction or try to hold her eyes for a couple of seconds however some girls are just shy and they may not want to make eye contact with you try encouraging her with other steps smiling shows your interest and makes it easy for her to smile back at you sometimes it might take a while for both of you to just make eye contact and smile before you’re ready to actually talk to each other even if you’re nervous smiling is a good way to make contact because a smile actually acts as a reward to other people in other words when you smile at her her brain perceives it as a reward making her happier to be around you don’t just hang around with the same group of friends it’s much easier to approach someone who is alone rather than someone who's with a large group so if you make sure you're alone sometime when she's around she might come over and talk to you you could also try and go alone to a place you know she will be to make yourself a little more available you never know what might happen for instance maybe you notice she spends time at the library after school make it a point to show up there too try sitting at a table near her where she can see you you don’t have to do much more at first if you’re shy if she’s unwilling to say “hi” back she might not be interested try it a few more times but if she never responds let it go you might be nervous about approaching her but the only way you can really test your theory of whether she likes you or not is to actually talk to her if she’s responded to your greeting you can move ahead to actually talking to each other consider what you know about her as that can lead to a conversation is she part of the drama club or does she play sports engaging with her about school activities is a great first way to make conversation you could even try to be funny but that can be hard you could ask is your training on the track team really hard or what did you think of the pep rally you could also say something like wasn't the food gross in the cafeteria today isn't it awful what they call food or don’t you think mr looks and sounds a lot like now that you have some possible questions find a good time to talk to her it should be a time when neither of you is off to class or activities and hopefully when you’re both alone it can feel really awkward the first time but it does get easier if she really responds and starts asking you questions too chances are that she is interested in you if she doesn’t really respond it’s likely she’s not that into you for example if you asked whether her track training was hard she might say yes but i love it in that case you could say cool what do you love about it i've always thought about getting into running but it seems really hard \\n\"]\n",

can ask her about it to learn more for example if you know she is interested in basketball you can ask her how long she has been playing this can also lead into the two of you going to play basketball together in order to spend more time with the girl you like it is helpful to join something she is part of like an after school club a team or a volunteer organization for example if the girl you like volunteers at a retirement home on the weekends you could also sign up to volunteer at the retirement home if she is part of the debate club at school and you’re interested in debate you could join that club and spend more time with her there it may be tempting to hide behind a screen but you need to spend time with the girl you like in real life your relationship will develop when you have connections in the real world and not only over the phone or computer don’t ever try to be someone you’re not you want the girl you like to like you not a persona you’ve for example if she is part of the school band but you don’t play an instrument you shouldn’t join the band just to spend time with her you could attend the band’s concerts to support her while finding another activity or interest you have in common remember to keep up your own interests as well if you're spending time doing an activity that she likes still make time to do that you like girls like when you have your own interests and hobbies good communication is the key to any relationship romantic or not you should try and communicate everyday whether in person over the phone or through social media remember not to overdo it with your communication if the girl you like is pulling back or cutting your conversations short take a break from communicating she may be busy or simply uninterested make sure you are listening attentively when she talks keep comfortable eye contact and nod while she speaks so she knows you’re listening follow up with relevant questions to really show that you’re paying attention and care about what she has to say if she is sharing something with you try to commit it to memory this shows her that you care about what she is saying and that you're interested in her for example if she says “my brother really loves basketball he has a game this weekend ” you should remember her name that way after the weekend you can say something like “hey how was your weekend how did do at his game ” girls love when people make them laugh embrace your natural sense of humor and ensure you are both having a good time whenever you hang out you don’t have to be a stand up comedian to make the girl you like laugh you can share a funny story you’ve heard or a silly pun one of your friends came up with if you’re shy or don’t think you’re funny don’t force yourself to tell jokes focus on making the girl you like smile while you learn what sort of things make her laugh for example you could watch a comedy special together or go to an improv show and laugh together drop small hints like compliments or hanging out one on one that show this girl you like her as more than just a friend for example if you notice she is wearing a new sweater you could say “wow that sweater looks great on you you look really beautiful today ” this type of compliment is sincere shows you notice small details and sounds romantic which may help her to see you in a romantic way you could also ask her to hang out one on one for example you could suggest a study date by saying “do you want to go to a cafe and study for our spanish test tonight just the two of us i’ll treat you to a cup of hot chocolate great hint that you like her is giving her a gift you want to make sure the gift is a small and thoughtful token and not something expensive and impersonal the gift should be something you bought because it made you think of her and shows that you care if the girl you like is interested in you as well she may begin to drop some hints that she wants to be more than friends look for moments when she is acting flirty touching you or making plans to spend alone time with you she may also be dropping hints that she is not interested if she invites other people to hang out with you or talks about other people she has feelings for she may not be interested in anything more than friendship with you everyone has a slightly different way of showing that they’re interested just because she is showing lots of signs that she likes you doesn’t mean that she does for sure and if she isn’t showing any signs it doesn’t mean she’s not interested it’s important to be honest with the girl that you like as you’re building up your friendship be direct and tell her how you feel if you think she might be feeling the same way you could follow up by asking her on a date for example you could say “i’ve enjoyed all this time we’ve been spending together lately and i really like you would you want to go out with me ” make it obvious that you are inviting her on a romantic date because you have feelings for her and not just a hang out as friends give the girl you like time to answer whatever her answer be respectful of her decision and accept how she feels \\n\"]\n",

flames or old friends or to meet new people it takes some of the risk out of online dating through someone’s social media profile you can see a slightly less version of their lives and check if you have mutual friends or interests sending a quick personal message is painless and there’s no pressure for the other person to respond if they aren’t interested sometimes crushes are unavoidable know when you should let your crush in on your attraction or keep it to yourself if your crush is in a relationship of any kind let it go period you don’t want to break up your crush and their significant other and chances are they won’t return your feelings even if they do it’s sure to become messy should go with out saying but only approach good people if you have any knowledge that your crush has done or said something violent cruel or illegal run in the other direction no matter how in books and movies the girl” or boy” never makes for a good partner if you do like a friend make sure it’s worth the risk letting a friend know you want more out of the friendship might lead to awkwardness or distance make a pros and cons list and think about how this specific person might respond if they don’t return your feelings if you decide your crush is worthy of your attention begin with small gestures of attention this way you can clue them in on your feelings without scaring them away invite them to group events you don’t have to start out asking your date to a romantic dinner for two try inviting them to casual hangouts with your friends you can show them how fun you are in a social setting without the pressure of private conversation extend an open ended invitation for example if you find out this person likes sushi say something like “we should get sushi sometime ” if they say “yes ” it leaves it up to them to make the actual plans and if they never follow up they probably weren’t truly interested use body language when you’re hanging out give them a small touch on the arm or sit slightly closer to them than you would one of your friends gauge their physical reaction to your closeness if they return these small gestures unconsciously chances are good that they like you too simple flirting can help you win over your crush flirting doesn't have to be stressful or complicated add emojis if you're texting try adding just a few smiley faces to your messages to let your crush know that talking to them makes you smile tease him a little don't be mean but little bit of playful teasing can go a long way use your eyes let him catch you staring and quickly look away being shy can make talking to your crush that much more difficult work on your confidence so you can approach your crush it's okay to be nervous don't try too hard to hide it your crush will think it's sweet focus on your crush not yourself think about all the great things about them shyness often begins when you are too focused on your own insecurities start with a common interest talk about something you love and are very familiar with this will help you avoid awkward pauses text communicating through texts can be a great way for a shy person to get to know someone it will help you become comfortable and make it easier to talk in person after you have hinted your affections subtly for a while let your crush know how you feel don’t think you have to wait for your crush to make the first big move keep your statement short and simple don’t feel like you have to initiate in person write a quick note or send a text message after a hang out sessions after this invite them to do something that is clearly a date say something like “i have really enjoyed getting to know you better would you want to go out to dinner with me on ” keep it simple and specific if someone doesn’t respond to your flirting or rejects you outright let them go don’t dwell on what you could have done differently and don’t try to change their mind at this stage in the relationship take what your crush says at face value look at a “no” as an opportunity to meet someone even better remember this will take time don’t be discouraged if you continue to have feelings for your crush just do your best to interact with new people and don’t be tempted to continue trying to flirt with your crush let yourself be sad it’s fine to take a day or a week to wallow a little vent to your friends treat yourself to a nice meal if you’ve been flirting with your crush for a while but you’re still not sure whether or not they return your feelings it can help to ask friends try to ask friends who know your crush fairly well sometimes an objective opinion can help you understand what someone really feels if your friends think your crush is interested it may be time to be more blunt with your crush about their feelings just ask them like this “hey i have a confession to make i have been really crushing on you lately just wondering if maybe you felt the same ” if your crush returns your feelings

      "Question :  ['fruit is a great source of vitamins for your guinea pig however while your guinea pig might enjoy fruit you should only use it as a snack or a treat as a result you don’t need to buy nearly as much fruit as vegetables and for many people fruit you have around the house already may be used when shopping for fresh fruit consider apples pears peaches unlike fruit you can feed your guinea pig large amounts of vegetables every week when buying vegetables consider carrots green peppers tops cucumbers brussel sprouts pelleted foods are a mix of hay vitamins and other food sources that serve as a staple in your guinea pig’s diet they are much healthier for your guinea pigs than other types of food because they are not dyed with artificial colors and flavors focus only on corn free and seed free pellets pellets enriched with vitamins are okay while your guinea pig will be getting some hay in his or her pellets fresh hay is an important element of a guinea pig’s diet and overall health this is because guinea pigs need hay in order to keep their teeth from overgrowing in addition hay keeps their digestive system clean be aware that a lot of hay sold at large chain stores is not high quality hay try to buy fresh hay at pet stores or at farm supply stores timothy hay is perfect for adult guinea pigs baby and pregnant guinea pigs will need alfalfa hay which has a higher vitamin and mineral content in it at the start of every day you should put out fresh vegetables for your guinea pig and since vegetables are an important part of your guinea pig’s diet you need to make sure that he or she has plenty of vegetables throughout the day feed your guinea pig about one cup of vegetables for every two pounds he or she weighs break your vegetable servings up into at least two this way your guinea pig will have fresh and vegetables throughout the day whenever you provide new vegetables remove any old uneaten or spoiled vegetables from the previous serving while fruit is important and can provide your guinea pig with badly needed vitamins you need to limit his or her consumption of it fruit should be served to your guinea pig as a treat not as a main course limit fruit treats to once or twice a week try to only feed your guinea pig one or two tablespoons of fruit for every two pounds that your guinea pig weighs only provide fresh and washed fruit to your guinea pig providing fresh hay throughout the day and week is extremely important for your guinea pig’s health since hay can accumulate bacteria guinea pig waste you’ll want to remove old hay periodically and replace it with fresh hay don’t be afraid of giving your guinea pig too much hay more is always better than less make sure your hay has not been sitting around the house too long at around the same time you serve your guinea pig vegetables you should also serve fresh pellets this is important as pellets are the foundation of your guinea pig’s diet provide 1 to 1 cup of pellets per day amount fed will vary based on size and age of the guinea pig feel free to divide pellets up into 2 or 3 servings if your guinea pig tends to overeat or eat it all at once serve the pellets in a ceramic bowl you also need to make sure that your guinea pig has plenty of fresh water fresh water is essential to your guinea pig’s diet and will help with digestion of hay pellets and the other food you provide as a result monitor water closely consider using a plastic drip bottle provide a water bowl too check your guinea pig’s water at least once a day change and clean your guinea pig’s water bowel and drip bottle a couple times a week guinea pigs of different ages have different dietary needs as a result when thinking about and a well balanced diet for your guinea pig you need to think about their age if you adopted your guinea pig as a baby then you should have an accurate idea of his or her age if you don’t know your guinea pig’s age consult a veterinarian or someone with specialized knowledge when establishing your guinea pig’s age you don’t need to be exact just be able to your guinea pig in one of several stages of life including baby youth adult or senior depending on sex your guinea pig’s dietary needs will vary sex is also important when determining your guinea pig’s age while for the most part male and female guinea pigs require the same nutrition there are a couple things you should consider if your guinea pig is pregnant you’ll need to alter her food mix if you are trying to breed your guinea pig you should probably alter the breeding pig’s diets to increase their vitamin intake your guinea pig might have special individual needs that will impact his or her dietary needs as a result you need to consider any special or unique factors that could influence your guinea pig’s health or diet does your guinea pig have any chronic medical problems does your guinea pig have any disorders or other unique factors that might impact his or her dietary needs \\n']\n",

      "Question :  [\"of cleaning wood tile linoleum or vinyl flooring materials are much easier to clean and will not harbor allergens like a carpet would if you're allergic to guinea pigs it's important to remember that the protein responsible for that allergy is mostly found in the animal's saliva and urine however that protein can be to the guinea pig's coat or skin during grooming or passing waste and may be to your skin if you handle the guinea pig or its bedding therefore the urine saliva hair and skin dander should all be considered potential sources of allergen exposure exposure to these allergens can cause symptoms immediately or after numerous days weeks months or even years of exposure if you are unable to avoid being around a guinea pig for whatever reason make sure you avoid contact with these sources of allergens if contact cannot be avoided make sure you take protective measures protective equipment may allow you to handle guinea pigs and their bedding or simply be around guinea pigs without experiencing allergic reactions protective equipment may not be enough though and you may need to take some type of allergy medication for extra safety wearing a dust mask can help prevent bronchial irritation and asthma like symptoms if you've experienced those symptoms in the past gloves and long sleeved shirts can help reduce your skin contact with guinea pigs especially while handling the animals themselves or cleaning their cages do not wear the long sleeved shirt you wore while handling your guinea pig for other purposes unless it's been washed since the last time you came into contact with the guinea pig or its bedding any time you've handled a guinea pig cleaned its enclosure or handled any materials from inside that enclosure make sure you wash your hands as soon as possible it's important to follow proper hand washing techniques to ensure that your skin is clean and free of allergens to reduce or prevent a reaction get your hands wet under the faucet with clean running water the temperature doesn't really matter since the point is to wash away allergens and not germs apply enough soap to adequately cover both hands with the lather work the soap between your hands between your fingers on the backs of your hands and under your fingernails apply soap to any other part of your body that may have come in contact with allergens wrists and arms for example scrub the soap on your skin for at least 20 seconds a common way to keep time is by singing or humming the happy birthday song twice in a row while you scrub your skin if you've been bitten or scratched by a guinea pig wash the site of your injury with soap and water for 15 minutes or longer to ensure that you remove the allergens from the wound rub your hands under the tap to wash away any traces of soap which should also remove the allergens your skin came into contact with use a clean dry paper towel to wipe your hands dry discard the paper towel when you are finished depending on your situation you may be able to find someone else willing to take on guinea pig duties for you ask others you live or work with if they would be willing to take over these responsibilities if you work at a pet store let your know that you've experienced allergic reactions to guinea pigs and request that you be excused from handling feeding or cleaning them if your guinea pig is a pet at home ask a family member or roommate to take over guinea pig duties if you can't find anyone willing to do this you may have to consider giving your guinea pig to a home where allergies won't be a problem though it's always difficult to part with a pet you may not have a choice if your allergies are severe talk to pet stores and adoption agencies in your region to see if they can help you find a new home for your guinea pig you should also make sure that any home your pet ends up in is safe by talking to the prospective buyer and asking about his or her previous pet ownership and animal care experience if you're experiencing allergies around a guinea pig there is a slight chance that it may not be the guinea pig itself causing your reactions an allergist can help you identify whether you're allergic to some environmental factor like hay straw used for the animal's bedding hay and straw often cause asthma like reactions including difficulty breathing increased production of mucus and congestion in the chest many people experience dermatitis symptoms as an allergic reaction to skin contact with hay straw dermatitis is usually characterized by red itchy or inflamed skin it may look like a rash on the skin usually at the point of exposure some people experience allergic reactions to wood shavings that are commonly used as guinea pig bedding talk to an allergist or try out a different bedding material that's free from any potential allergens even if wood shavings themselves aren't the problem many people experience allergies to the various coloring fragrances and oils added to guinea pig bedding eucalyptus oil and oil are common additives to guinea pig bedding make sure your wood shavings do not have any of these additives or try a different bedding material altogether if bedding isn't the issue there is a slight chance you may be allergic to the food you're feeding your guinea pig handling food or treats that contain an artificial color or other additives could be what's causing your reaction though only an allergist can confirm this for sure artificial coloring agents that begin with the letter e such as are commonly added to dried food and treats these coloring agents have produced allergic reactions in some individuals though again it's more likely that you're allergic to the animal itself or its bedding talk to an allergist

      "Question :  [\"monkey you own monkeys like to climb so provide a cage with plenty of height add branches hanging ropes and other features that will allow your monkey to climb around the cage most monkey owners allow their pets to spend time around the house rather than just in their cages monkeys are curious intelligent creatures that will get into everything available to them so you'll need to take the time to remove items that could cause them harm or suffer damage since monkeys can climb your monkey proofing will have to be more extensive than baby proofing would be don't let monkeys have access to anything with a cord make sure all electronics are out of their reach they'll tear down curtains knock over lamps and chew on furniture put away any items you aren't comfortable letting them destroy you might want to have one or two designated monkey rooms that the monkeys are allowed to play in and have the rest of the house be off limits remember that monkeys can turn and open windows so if you're planning to let the monkey stay there unsupervised you'll need to make sure the room is as secure as a cage would be with locks and bars on the windows monkeys keep their own bodies clean but they leave a mess wherever they go they aren't easy to house train and they whenever and wherever they choose some people put diapers on baby monkeys but this isn't usually possible once the monkeys mature rather you should plan on cleaning up after your monkey at least once a day to maintain sanitary conditions in the cage and in your home monkeys should always have access to fresh water that they drink from clean water bottles you can use baby bottles for this purpose some monkeys may prefer to take their water from a dish and some might like to have both options however you administer the water make sure there's no chance the monkey will run out monkey biscuits or commercial monkey food should be fed to your monkey every single day these biscuits contain the right combination of vitamins and minerals to meet your monkey's needs in addition to monkey biscuits monkeys enjoy cut up fruit and fresh or vegetables you may also feed your monkey grasshoppers mealworms cooked chicken with no spices hard boiled eggs yogurt rice grain and nuts do not feed your monkey anything that is considered junk food for a human sugary treats ice cream baked goods snack foods fast food and raw meat should never be fed to a monkey depending on the type of monkey you have you may also need to supplement his diet with extra vitamins monkeys kept inside may need extra vitamin d to account for the lack of sun exposure monkeys need a lot of variety and stimulation in order to be happy in the wild they spend most of their time climbing around trees and looking for food that experience in your monkey's cage and around the house by providing lots of interesting things for the monkey to play with and pull apart try hiding the monkey's food inside a box or in a container with small holes that the monkey can reach one hand into the monkey will have fun trying to figure out how to get to the food give the monkey stuffed animals balls and other toys to throw around and play with switch out the toys frequently so the monkey won't get bored monkeys are social creatures and when they're left alone for long periods of time they grow very unhappy spend a few hours playing with your monkey every single day as you bond with your monkey he'll start trusting you enough to climb up your body and give you hugs or even kisses if you have more than one monkey less social time is necessary many monkeys are happier living with others of their kind if you can afford more than one they'll live happily together in the same cage hitting or yelling at a monkey will cause him to become afraid of you it's also completely ineffective if you want to control your monkey's behavior remember that monkeys are wild and they simply can't be trained to do exactly what you want them to do from time to time they'll exhibit behaviors you might not like punishing them will only hurt your relationship the best way to deal with negative behaviors is to make sure the monkey isn't lacking something that he needs to be content does he have enough stimulation every day is he getting plenty of exercise are you playing with him enough monkeys that are afraid or agitated might bite from time to time again you can't deal with this by punishing the monkey instead get to know his moods and learn to leave him alone when he might be in the mood to bite it's not a good idea to take your monkey out in public or invite people to your home to play with him monkeys are too unpredictable your monkey can get taken away in an instant if an accident happens if your monkey so much as scratches someone an animal control has the right to confiscate him to test him for rabies when exotic animals are they are often euthanized since there is no law requiring a quarantine period for exotic animals as there is for domesticated animals like cats and dogs if you have to go out of town and leave the monkey in someone else's care make sure it's someone the monkey has met many times and has come to trust leaving the monkey with a total stranger could be stressful for him and lead to dangerous consequences say his name when you feed him or offer them a toy so he'll begin to learn it when he responds give him a treat and praise him teach him commands by showing him how to act for example if you say dance start hopping around and dancing when he learns a trick give him treats

      "Question :  [\"healthy mouth will make you more kissable having visibly dirty teeth and bad breath will likely keep people from wanting to kiss you make sure you brush twice each day and floss at least once it is good to get in this habit not only for your first kiss but for your own health as well have breath mints handy so you can toss one in your mouth if you end up eating or drinking before the time you plan to kiss the other person don’t chew gum although it will give you fresh breath having gum in your mouth during your first kiss can make it more difficult to enjoy the moment because you will have to worry about where the gum is in your mouth if your lips are chapped and dry the kiss will be less comfortable for both of you use a lip moisturizer such as vaseline regularly if you are a girl avoid sticky lip glosses the person kissing you may find it weird and if your lips are very sticky and messy this is probably the hardest part of any first kiss however if you want to kiss the person you are with look for signs that he or she wants to kiss you too often a good time is if you’ve been spending some time together alone having good conversation are they making a lot of eye contact obviously this doesn’t always mean they want to kiss you but if they make a lot of eye contact they at least find you interesting if they want to kiss you often they will be staring into your eyes or looking at your lips what does their body language say if they have their arms folded across their chest then they probably don’t want a kiss however if they have their body angled towards you are sitting or standing close to you with arms open then it’s likely a good bet remember that this moment could be planned or it could happen spontaneously try to stay calm and go with the flow there are certain moments where it is more likely for example if it is the end of the night just before you both go home or if you are alone in a quiet moment although it is ok to take a quick peek every now and then it is usually better to keep your eyes closed if your partner realizes you have your eyes open he she might feel uncomfortable it will also help you to relax if your eyes are closed when the kiss happens don’t immediately try to stick your tongue in his her mouth instead start out by gently kissing with just your lips and if the kiss continues to that proceed slowly there is no need to rush when it comes to kissing the worst thing you can do is to over think your first kiss remember that no matter what happens it is only one kiss and there will be many others once you get the first kiss out of the way you can practice getting better at it enjoy the moment you only get one first kiss and you will likely remember it for your entire life be present during the kiss don’t start thinking about how you can’t wait to tell your friends or write about it in your diary simply enjoy it think about why you want to experience your first kiss is it because you think you have to in order to be or is it because you feel that you actually want to have this experience there might be many reasons you want to experience your first kiss but in general it is a good idea to wait until you feel ready for it choose someone that you feel comfortable with and who wants to kiss you back typically this will be your boyfriend or girlfriend but in some cases it may also be a close friend who wants to have the experience too whoever it is it will be more enjoyable if it is someone you trust and feel comfortable with although the cutest girl or boy in school might be an obvious choice it doesn’t mean they are the best choice you should choose someone you find attractive on the inside as much as the outside ask trusted friends about their first kiss and how they prepared themselves ask them what advice they can give you if you feel comfortable doing so you can also discuss it with your parents don't be afraid to ask questions almost every one can remember the nervousness and worries they had before their first kiss it's likely that you will be worrying about all the things that could go wrong during your first kiss ignore these thoughts instead let yourself think only positive thoughts for example you can think about how you've taken good care of your lips and mouth making you very kissable you can think about how into you the person you will be kissing is and how romantic it will be although you will be nervous remember that you deserve to be kissed believe that the kiss will go well and although it may not go perfectly it will all be ok remember that even if it doesn't go perfectly it is only the first of many nearly everyone feels nervous when kissing someone for the first time this is a biological reaction to our excitement and doesn’t mean anything bad remember that this also goes for the person kissing you back it can sometimes be a comfort to remember the other person is also nervous if you do your best to act relaxed about the kiss it will help your partner relax too and you can both enjoy it often the first kiss will be everything you hoped it would be despite the fact that it didn't go perfectly however if things aren't turning out so well don't get angry instead pull away from your partner and smile it will help both of you relax and you can try again if you want to \\n\"]\n",
